# RPI-NFC-Test
NFC HID to Serial Module

Final_serial file reads the standard intput from USB-NFC HID device and sends to serial port.

Currently having issue when binary run via system e.g. binary starts when usb HID matches the PID for my device.
the binary stops after 30s when device is detected.

Need changes.
